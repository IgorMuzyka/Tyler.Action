# Action

This repo provides a way to *associate* **Actions** with native views after they are constructed from **Tile** configuration of [Tyler](https://github.com/IgorMuzyka/Tyler). This repo is barely enough implementation to support this feature but it at least provides a view of how this should probably be done.
